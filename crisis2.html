        <li>Usually, directives are written by an individual during a moderated caucus when other delegates are speaking. The directive is then passed around the committee to collect signatories.<br>
        Directives can be joint or individual:<br>
        •	Joint – written by multiple delegates<br>
        •	Individual -written by a single delegate<br>
        </li>
       <li> Directives are of two types covert and overt:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Covert: secretive</li><br>
        <li>Overt: public<br></li>
        </ul>
    <li>Sponsors are those that have directly contributed to writing the document</li><br>
       <li>Signatories are individuals who are interested in seeing the document presented for voting, but do not necessarily support the entirety of the document and did not contribute to writing it</li> .<br>

       </div> <b><center><div id="movie"><h1><kbd>Press release:</kbd></h1></div></center></b><br>
        Press Releases are tools used by committees or individuals to inform “the public” in the crisis about certain facts, or to spread misinformation about the ongoing crisis. Often, delegates may use these to try to influence public opinion against certain plans to help their own,<br> to encourage the public to be safe, to stop protesting, or even to get involved with the crisis somehow.<br>
        Main Components of a Press Release <br>
        • Header stating that it is a Press Release <br>
        • Descriptive Headline-like newspaper<br>
         • Things you want to tell the public<br>
         • Signature/s<br>
        <b><center><div id="akm"><h1><kbd>Communique:</kbd></h1></div></center></b><br>
        Communiques are tools used to contact people or bodies outside of your committee in order to involve them in the crisis and tell them to take action. You can write communiques as an individual delegate or as a committee.<br> It is used To get an outside actor/party to act for you or your committee to impact the crisis<br>
        
        Main Components of a Solid Communique <br>
        • Header that says “Communique” (so it isn’t mistaken as a directive)<br>
         • Addressee, with formal title and name<br>
         • The specific action or information you want them to undertake or give you <br>
